# Getting Started
> This project uses Grunt, follow the instructions to get started

Make sure you have Node.js and Grunt installed:

- Install Node.js from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org), or if you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install node`
- Install Grunt by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Install project dependancies with `npm install`. Make sure you're in the project root.

You may need to run the install commands as admin, so for Mac, use `sudo npm install`.

For more information on Grunt, see the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.
